### Store Hours Restriction App

A simple yet powerful Shopify application that restricts when shoppers can purchase products. Merchants can configure their store’s “open” hours in the Shopify admin, and the app will:
•	Disable the “Add to Cart” button on product pages when the store is closed.
•	Prevent shoppers from checking out if they attempt to do so during closed hours.

This ensures your store only operates within the schedule you specify.
